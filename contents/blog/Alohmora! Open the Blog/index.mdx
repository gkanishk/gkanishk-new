description: Blogs are the best way to convey what we have learned and whatever we have experienced. So here's a blog on how and where to write a blog.
---

We all render and produce our own content, say if it’s a project, or if it’s a blog, it can be anything that is productive to dust our skills. Anything we make should be shared, now someone will ask why to share?🤝

Perks of sharing:👇

Number one that boosts our confidence
People come to know you know that stack
FEEDBACK!😲 Yes, that’s the most important, we get to know where we are lagging and how we can improve ourselves.
So the agenda I am going to discuss today is “Blogs”, why should we write and where to share?

Why should we write a blog?✍
We sharpen our skills every time we learn something new or we make anything new, so blogs are the best way to share your knowledge and thoughts, say if you are making a project or you have achieved something, anytime someone asks you “how have you done so?” so your answer will be simple “Here’s the link to my blog!” and you are good to go.

You will become famous like Harry Potter🧙‍♂️ everyone knows him right?

People will come to know that you are having prior knowledge and have worked on that stack. also, that improves your ability to write and share.

How to write a blog
Where should one post his blog?🏴‍
In Deathly Hallows when Harry Potter was traveling back then everyone drank brew so that they could look like Harry Potter and he could be protected from Voldemort as he was underaged.

So the answer is everywhere!! I mean you should post your blog everywhere, post it on LinkedIn, medium, dev.to, and so on. But my answer is first at your own platform.

Where to post the blog
The brew lasted for some time and after that everyone was restored back to normal so other platforms may terminate but if you will post them inside your own blog then that will last long with you because

"My blogs are my blogs and none of your blogs!"
Tips on how to post and maintain them:
Synchronize everything:🤩
Now that you have written your blog, the first step is to post that in your own personal blog after a few days when the SEO becomes active, write and share on another platform and connect them writing this was originally written at your own blog mentioning your personal link. So that people will come to know that there’s a blog where they can find interesting articles.

Identity:🤺
Even though in the movie all Harrys were not the same but everyone looked like Harry Potter which means identity was common with them. So remember one thing whenever you post any content make sure your identity remains the same everywhere, what I mean is your user handles and name.

If you will have the same handles everywhere then it will be easier for everyone to find you. For example, my username remains the same everywhere i.e.

“gkanishk”
if you Google me i.e. Kanishk Gupta here or my username here you will get all my information out of the box say my portfolio, LinkedIn, Twitter, and all my activities.

Interesting using stories:👻🐱‍👤
There must be thousands of blogs on the same topic but what should make a difference is how you represent it and make that interesting for the reader, try to connect your blog with any story like any movie any series or something that will compel the reader to read like any game.

Why wait just levitate your own blog you can build that from scratch or make that using Gatsby starter kits available as quick as 30 minutes.

One can also make a blog using Sanity.io that’s an automated tool where zero codings are required to build any starter site.

Voila! Now you are famous like Harry Potter.
