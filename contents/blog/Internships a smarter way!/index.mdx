Internships in a smarter way!
Internship
Many people asked me how did I get my internship in the first and second year, how can they get one.

Well, good internships are hard to find but not so difficult. We can get one in a smarter way.

There are many platforms which list internships offers like Internshala, Frapp and many more so you can get one from there but what I did was different I used google search for that.

Before you apply make sure you have relevant skills and are focused on which domain you want to apply for an internship. So first you should have relevant projects you have worked with an online portfolio would be great.

Fields in which you will easily get internships are:

Web Development
Mobile App Development
Content Writing
Data Management
Machine Learning
Technologies
Try to focus on any one domain and work on them.

Now comes how to apply and get an internship you can internships at a startup company they are good to work with as you will gain much experience and exposure towards work and also build good connections as compared to a well-reputed company if you wanna aim for a well-reputed company then you need a strong connection search on LinkedIn about internships available at company you are aiming for then apply for that company and make sure your portfolio is well structured with good projects.

Now coming to startups ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

The first thing you have to do is search for top IT companies in the domain you are looking for like "Top Web Development Companies in Bangalore " and you will get a couple of results based on your search.

After that try to visit the page of each company once and look at there work shortlist 10 good companies, Now you must ask how to know whether the company is good or bad so here is how you will come to know once you visit there page go through there work a good company will keep posting updates on their page and see the reviews when you search for the company more good reviews means a good company and accordingly shortlist them.

After you shortlist them note there contact details like contact number and email try to focus on the contact number as you will get an instant result, and after that try contacting each company one by one telling about your details and that you found them interesting,

tell that you are interested to work with them so is there option available for you and that's it, if they are interested they will contact you for an interview or ask about work you have done.

If you don't get one through 10 shortlisted one then again shortlist 10 more companies and you will surely get one to work on with.

This is how I got my internship at first and second year of my academics.

Hope it will help everyone.
